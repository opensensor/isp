# Cline Rules for ISP Driver Project

## Build Environment Rules

### DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BUILD KERNEL MODULES ON THIS MACHINE
- This development machine (WSL2) is not set up for kernel module compilation
- The target hardware is MIPS-based T31 SoC running Linux 3.10
- Building requires cross-compilation toolchain and target kernel headers
- Focus on code analysis, debugging, and source code fixes instead
- Any compilation attempts will fail due to missing kernel headers and wrong architecture

### When User Asks About Building:
- Explain that this is a development/analysis environment only
- Suggest that building should be done on the target hardware or proper cross-compilation environment
- Focus on code correctness and static analysis instead

### Acceptable Development Tasks:
- Code analysis and review
- Adding forward declarations and fixing compilation errors in source
- Debugging kernel crashes from logs
- Implementing missing functions based on Binary Ninja analysis
- Documentation and code comments
- Static analysis with tools like clang-tidy

### NOT Acceptable:
- Running `make` or attempting kernel module compilation
- Installing kernel headers for wrong architecture
- Trying to set up cross-compilation without explicit user request
- Complaining about missing build environment when it's intentional
